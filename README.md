My first repository

Hi people!

Dave here.  I am learning javascript, html, and css in an attempt to learn how to start coding.  I'm not sure where i want to go with it yet but I figure it's a good start and I'm enjoying new things and the puzzle solving exercises of javascript.

More practice on making commits...
